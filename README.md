# S.A.I.T.O Project

The SAITO (or Saito) project is a project using the Python language as the basis of everything. Currently, the project works only on the Windows operating system, but in the future I intend to create a Branch in order to run the project on Linux as well.

This readme is only a temporary text that I intend to improve over the course of the project.
