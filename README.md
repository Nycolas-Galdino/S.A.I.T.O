# S.A.I.T.O Project

The SAITO (or Saito) project is a project using the Python language as the basis of everything. Currently, the project works only on the Windows operating system, but in the future I intend to create a Branch in order to run the project on Linux as well.

Saito is an artificial intelligence created in order to considerably improve the use of the PC over the course of the day.

This readme is only a temporary text that I intend to improve over the course of the project.
